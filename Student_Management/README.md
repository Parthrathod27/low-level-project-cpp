# Student Record Management System (C++)

A **console-based Student Record Management System** built using **C++ and File Handling**. This project allows users to **add, view, search, update, and delete student records** stored permanently in a text file.

This is a **low-level / beginner-friendly project** focused on understanding:

* File handling (`fstream`)
* Classes and objects
* Menu-driven programs
* CRUD operations
* Basic input/output handling

---

## 📌 Features

* ➕ Add new student record
* 📄 View all student records
* 🔍 Search student by roll number
* ✏️ Update existing student record
* ❌ Delete student record
* 💾 Data stored permanently in a file (`students.txt`)
* ⏳ Loading animation for better user experience

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** C++
* **Concepts:**

  * Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  * File Handling (`ifstream`, `ofstream`)
  * Loops & Conditions
  * Console UI formatting (`iomanip`)
